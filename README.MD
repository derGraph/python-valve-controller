# Flow control of a turbine
This project is a PI flow control to keep the waterlevel in a simulated surge chamber constant. It is written in python and can be opened with pyCharm.

The code is described with comments.

These parameters can be changed:
- waterlevel at start (m)
- size of the tank (m2)
- waterflow in the tank at the beginning (m3)
- set level (m)
- waterflow out of the tank at the beginning (m3)
- P and I gains
